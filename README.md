### üèõÔ∏è Design Patterns

- **Provider Pattern**: State management across the application
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access and API abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic widget and service creation
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time data updates and notifications
- **Singleton Pattern**: Shared services and configurations

### üîÑ State Management

We use the **Provider** pattern for state management:

```dart
// Example: Weather Provider
class WeatherProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  WeatherData? _currentWeather;
  bool _isLoading = false;
  
  WeatherData? get currentWeather => _currentWeather;
  bool get isLoading => _isLoading;
  
  Future<void> fetchWeather(double lat, double lon) async {
    _isLoading = true;
    notifyListeners();
    
    try {
      _currentWeather = await WeatherService.getWeather(lat, lon);
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error
    } finally {
      _isLoading = false;
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
}
```
